Tips
To install:
“tdnf install git tar tree”

Since 1.14, Kubectl also supports the management of Kubernetes objects using a kustomization file
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/
kubectl kustomize overlays/production/

kubectl kustomize <kustomization_directory>

To apply those Resources, run kubectl apply with --kustomize or -k flag:

“kubectl apply -k <kustomization_directory>”

Delete
kubectl delete -k overlays/production


If you'd like to learn more about deployments and services, I highly recommend the KubeAcademy course, Kubernetes in-depth, which will explore these and other subjects related to Kubernetes in greater detail.
